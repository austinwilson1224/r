```{r}
# r code 
x = 1:10
x **2
```

why is this bad?

  - because 
  - some reasons
  
## your turn
```{r}
x = runif(n=100, min = 0, max = 1)
hist(x)
mean_of_x = mean(x)
```
the mean of x a random sample of a random sample uniformly distributed is `r mean_of_x`







```{r}
x = rnorm(n=100,mean=0,sd=1)
```
